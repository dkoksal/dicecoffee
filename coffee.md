Coffee
======

I just used instant folgers crystals for the first version. Will eventually come
up with something better, looking for a low-bitterness recipe, possibly
something incorporating mint.

Chocolate Iced Coffee
---------------------

Add 5 Ice cubes to foamed milk in heat-safe cup. Pour the coffee over ice and
blend them together until the drink is cold.
